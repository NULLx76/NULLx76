### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at the TU Delft.

I enjoy working on various programming sideprojects which can be found on this github profile.
The main programming languages I enjoy working in are Rust, Go and Elixir. 

I also have a homelab with various servers on which I run a variety of services, mostly on top of NixOS and Kubernetes, you can view my IaC [here](https://github.com/NULLx76/infrastructure).
All of the sites linked below are hosted on those servers.
