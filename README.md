### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at the TU Delft.

I enjoy creating various programming sideprojects which can be found on this github profile and in the [Finitum](../../../../finitum) organization.
The main programming languages I enjoy working in are Rust, Go and recently Elixir. 

I also have a homelab with various servers on which I run a variety of services, mostly on top of Kubernetes; some of the sites linked below are hosted on those servers.
